Joomla OSM Programme Module
---

This is an installable module for the [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/) content management system.  It allows a Joomla web site to show content from [OSM](onlinescoutmanager.co.uk/) (Online Scout Manager).  Specifically, the module displays the next meeting for a scout section.

Developed and tested on Joomla 4.  There's a good chance it will also work on Joomla 3 (please let me know if you configure it in this environment).
